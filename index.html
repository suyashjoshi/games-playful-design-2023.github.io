                        <p>
                            George Dunbar is mirror self for Noah, an embodiment of all they see as vile in the world previously used in satirical performance pieces. 
                            Noah was interested in the narrative exercise of treating this character seriously and writing them as a whole person and constructing how one would reach such a vileness. The narrative took the form of imagining what that would look like across the oncoming century and tying these decisions to the real traumatic childhood Noah and George share. It was also the chance to write the death of this character as an exorcism of neurosis of becoming like those who abused you.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The game works as a non linear post mortem narrative puzzle game. You will traverse a maze for keys, listen to the audio triggered, then discern which key is for which themed lock out of Despair, Ambition, Invention and Delicate Memories. You only have 4 chances to get this wrong so listen to the audio carefully. 
                            Warning the game contains reference to sexual assault, panic attacks and child abuse.

                                This is a physical puzzle game, a gift, for the person who matters most to me.
                                The game consists of four minigames with different mechanics, where the player is brought into Rebecca's point of view to play.

                            A narrative exploration game with strong horror and uncanny elements. 
                            You play as Mary, a woman who lives on an isolated farmstead along with her husband, Jim. One day while out tending the farm, you notice an odd sinkhole has appeared in the earth. 
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, strange occurrences begin to crop up around the farm, such as the disappearance of animals, and the increasingly anxious behaviour of your husband. 
                            You must now investigate the secrets of the hole and where it has come from, or risk your life as you know it sinking down into its dark depths.

                            Peacock is the embodiment of beauty, a symbol of comparison psychology, so this game wants to explore ""what is beauty"". 
                            Attractive beauty is certainly more than just external appearance but is also about the heart, thought, soul, and so on. However, we often stare at our flaws, ignoring our precious features and qualities, getting caught in anxiety and inferiority through comparison with others.

                            Especially after entering the Internet era, the comparison between people has intensified online. Regardless, can you now cast aside the judgments of others and wholeheartedly pursue becoming the person you want to be?

                        <p>
                            Dive into the Otherside is a 90s internet weirdcore game set in the early days of the graphical internet. 
                            One day in the 1990s, the otherwise safe Internet suddenly turned into a hellish place littered with horrific phenomena. These horrific phenomena, known as anomalies, use information as a medium, and the sanity of any human who observes them is severely damaged until it descends into complete madness. 
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In some extreme examples, incomprehensible supernatural phenomena have also occurred in their presence.
                            Players, as the registered investigator of organisation called “WatchTower”, will investigate these anomalies and their behaviour patterns, collect valuable information and discover the solution towards them in the end. 
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Your objective is to explore your assigned case, find out what happened to the missing investigators, and record details of the anomalies you encountered.
